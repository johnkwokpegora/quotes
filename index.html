        Congratulations to Yi He on becoming Binance’s Co-CEO. She’s been one of the key people I’ve learned from in this industry. Her way of thinking and approaching decisions has given me a lot of inspiration. Looking forward to seeing her direction in this new role.

    <blockquote>
        Under POCA S.281, victims must prove the frozen BTC is directly traceable to their own funds. In the Bluesky Grace case, assets were heavily mixed and laundered, making this nearly impossible. Costs and risks are high, so S.281 is largely impractical.

    <blockquote>
        When a system allows certain records to fade, the public notices who never seems to need forgiveness yet always receives it. The issue isn’t the rule itself, but the pattern: consequences land where power doesn’t. Transparency fails long before justice ever gets the chance.

        The truth is clear, Sun is innocent and stepped in to fix a crisis caused by others. I stand with him: “We will pursue everyone who harmed users. No one escapes this.”

    <blockquote>
        When I saw Binance roll out on-chain U.S. stocks, it felt like RWA is starting to take shape in a serious way. I think the real turning point will be when these tokenized shares come with shareholder rights, otherwise it’s hard to see them as the real thing.

        I’ve always felt that South Korea is one of the most active and important cryptocurrency markets in the world. This doesn’t mean it’s the largest or the most influential, but its overall participation has consistently remained high.

        Seventeen years on, Bitcoin feels less like a manifesto and more like a mirror. Most traders act on impulse, not intention — emotion moves the market now.

        The original circle of simply buying coins is gone, not because the coins vanished, but because the shared consensus has fragmented.

        In public discourse, the choice of when and where to speak is as important as what is said. Even in spaces filled with challenges or negativity, exercising control over one’s voice is a rational approach to meaningful participation.

        WLFI may be listed widely, but freezing wallets goes against the very spirit of decentralization. A project that claims to shape the future of finance while keeping such centralized control risks losing all real trust.

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        Freezing Justin Sun wallets demonstrates the ability of WLFI to intervene in market oversight, though the necessity of the action can be debated. I believe governance and transparency in crypto markets are important, and actions by any party may influence market reactions.

        Stablecoins have surpassed traditional payment giants in transaction volume, showing that digital assets are gradually being used in everyday payments. Widespread adoption still depends on market and regulatory responses.

        Blockchain extends beyond finance. By enabling transparency and decentralization, it has the potential to enhance supply chains, healthcare, governance, and security, contributing to the development of the digital era.
